### Automated Detection of COVID-19 Cases Using Deep Neural Networks with X-Ray Images

In this research, a novel deep learning approach is introduced for the automated identification of COVID-19 cases. The developed model aims to deliver precise diagnoses through binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our findings indicate that the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 98.08% for binary classification and 87.02% for multi-class classification.
